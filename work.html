    <h2>MK Cellular – Wireless Sales Consultant</h2>
    <p>At MK Cellular, I helped a wide range of customers — from tech-savvy young adults to elderly individuals needing patient support. We were known for taking the time to assist with everything, from account setup to app tutorials like Facebook. I often resolved signal issues, plan questions, billing confusion, and device troubleshooting. Our tools included RIM, Excel, and RQ.</p>
    <p>One of my proudest moments was helping a woman recover lost photos from a locked phone. I stayed past closing and ultimately used iTunes and several tools to recover her memories. In another case, I spent hours on the phone helping a mother and daughter navigate out of a restrictive third-party phone contract, providing personalized guidance with professionalism and persistence.</p>

    <h2>GameStop – Senior Game Advisor</h2>
    <p>As a Senior Game Advisor, I often managed the store alone — responsible for opening, closing, managing trades, handling fraud prevention, and optimizing inventory. I was promoted to this level within two weeks. Prioritizing tasks in a high-paced environment was critical, especially during rushes when 20+ customers could walk in within minutes. I especially enjoyed helping customers find the perfect deal or watching someone light up over a new release.</p>

    <h2>Lowe’s – Sales Associate, Tools & Hardware</h2>
    <p>At Lowe’s, I worked with everyone from skilled DIYers to first-timers who didn’t know what a drill was. I developed deep product knowledge about tools — what each brand was known for, what threading types were used for different tasks, and how to match solutions with customer needs. The role was fast-paced and pushed me to grow quickly in confidence and communication. It helped build the relational foundation that I now bring to all tech and support roles.</p>
