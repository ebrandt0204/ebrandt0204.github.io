    <h2>How It Started</h2>
    <p>I got involved in CRU my freshman year through my uncle, who connected me with someone at the Whitewater chapter. I attended the first meeting not knowing what to expect and sat next to two friendly guys named Ethan and Christian. One of them would later become one of my closest friends through all four years. I started attending Bible studies and connected with Alex, the Tech Coordinator. We bonded over Star Wars and even started a small niche group that watched it together weekly.</p>
    <p>At first, I just wanted friends — but I ended up finding both friendship and a deepened relationship with God.</p>

    <h2>Technical Ministry – CRU Tech Team</h2>
    <p>I joined the Tech Team my freshman year, learning from the current coordinator. I helped run sound and video at weekly events, working with equipment like a soundboard, XLR snakes, speaker systems, and wireless mics. I tuned audio levels based on the band’s performance, managed visuals, and handled real-time troubleshooting. This role sharpened my technical intuition and problem-solving under pressure.</p>

    <h2>Leadership as Communications Coordinator</h2>
    <p>Senior year, I stepped into the role of Communications Coordinator. I led a team that handled CRU's social media, photo/video teams, and online platforms. I helped launch our YouTube channel for sermon recordings and streamlined our photo-sharing process by switching from Google Drive to Google Photos, making albums easier to share and access.</p>
    <p>I also began leading a co-ed Bible study, preparing weekly materials and discussions, organizing mini-events, and guiding group conversations — experiences that deepened my leadership capacity and public communication skills.</p>

    <h2>Key Moments – Women's Appreciation Event</h2>
    <p>Each year, CRU hosts an appreciation event where the men serve the women and vice versa. When I noticed the men's coordinator struggling to lead this initiative, I stepped in and applied Agile principles from my coursework to organize tasks and assign teams. I facilitated planning meetings, delegated roles, and helped ensure the event’s success. It was incredibly rewarding to hear that many seniors said it was their favorite appreciation night ever.</p>

    <h2>Mission Trip & Personal Faith Growth</h2>
    <p>After my junior year, I joined a CRU mission trip without many expectations — and it changed my life. I gained a deeper understanding of sharing the Gospel and, through prayer and reflection, chose to get baptized. This experience pushed me to apply for a Core Team leadership role. Though I didn’t get the one I initially wanted, I was chosen for Communications and embraced it wholeheartedly.</p>
    <p>I began discipling two peers, developed the habit of daily Bible reading and prayer, and built new rhythms of accountability. My faith matured and my passion for serving others through ministry and leadership solidified.</p>

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>Looking back, CRU was more than a college ministry — it was where I discovered how to lead, serve, and walk closely with God. Every role, from soundboard to strategy meetings, helped shape me into someone who leads with both faith and purpose.</p>
