    <h2>Competing in Valorant</h2>
    <p>During my time at UW–Whitewater, I competed on the school's Valorant team, playing as both a Controller and Duelist. My experience began on the junior varsity roster my freshman year and progressed to team captain by sophomore year. In my junior year, I was promoted to the varsity squad where I competed at the highest level.</p>

    <h2>Leadership as Team Captain</h2>
    <p>As captain, I was responsible for organizing weekly practices, tracking team availability, scheduling matches, and maintaining the internal structure and morale of a developing team. Since the Valorant program was relatively new, I focused heavily on building community—organizing in-person team dinners and encouraging connection beyond the game.</p>

    <h2>Tools & Communication</h2>
    <p>Our team relied on Discord, Google Docs, and UW collegiate server networks to stay organized. From match logistics to role assignments and strategy discussions, these platforms helped us stay cohesive as a unit despite our different schedules and commitments.</p>

    <h2>Personal Growth & Team Dynamics</h2>
    <p>Leading the team taught me valuable lessons in humility, communication, and decision-making. I learned that I couldn't please everyone and that being an effective leader sometimes means holding firm to values while guiding others toward improvement. I also learned to listen—gaining insight from teammates and adjusting my approach to best serve the whole.</p>

    <h2>Stepping Away to Lead Elsewhere</h2>
    <p>In my senior year, I made the decision to step away from the team. While I valued the competitive experience, I recognized that my priorities were divided. I felt a growing call to leadership within CRU and ministry on campus, and stepping back from esports allowed me to lead more fully and grow in new ways.</p>
