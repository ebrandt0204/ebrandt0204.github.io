    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Ethan Brandt, an Information Technology graduate from the University of Wisconsin–Whitewater, with a strong foundation in technical troubleshooting, systems administration, and customer support. My passion for solving problems through technology is backed by years of experience working directly with end-users and systems in both professional and campus leadership roles.</p>

    <p>Throughout college, I gained experience across a range of real-world IT and customer-facing positions. At MK Cellular, I worked as a Wireless Sales Consultant, where I troubleshot mobile network and hardware issues, helped customers select best-fit tech solutions, and handled quoting and setup processes using Excel and internal network tools. Prior to that, I served at GameStop and Lowe’s, where I developed strong customer engagement, inventory management, and multitasking skills in high-pressure environments.</p>

    <p>Beyond my work experience, I was deeply involved in campus leadership through CRU (Campus Crusade for Christ). I served four years on the Tech Team, managing all audio/video production for events with up to 200 attendees. My senior year, I stepped into the Communications Coordinator role, where I led the content and social media team, launched CRU’s YouTube channel for recorded sermons, created a more efficient photo-sharing process, and managed Instagram, Facebook, and Linktree presence. I also served on the core leadership team to help direct major campus outreach efforts.</p>

    <p>My academic work has included projects such as configuring a multi-VM network with Windows Server 2022 and Linux, managing DHCP and Active Directory settings, and completing Agile-based team projects using Trello, Scrum roles, sprints, and burndown charts. These experiences helped me develop both technical fluency and project coordination skills that I carry into every team I’m a part of.</p>
