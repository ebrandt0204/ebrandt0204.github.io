    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I’m Ethan Brandt, a recent Information Technology graduate from UW–Whitewater with a BBA degree focused on systems administration, networking, and user support. I bring a background in customer service, technical troubleshooting, and team leadership—skills I’ve refined both in the classroom and in the field.</p>
    <p>My career journey began during college where I gained hands-on experience as a Wireless Sales Consultant at MK Cellular, solving mobile networking issues and configuring device connectivity. I further developed troubleshooting, communication, and time management skills through roles at GameStop and Lowe’s.</p>
    <p>At UW-Whitewater, I led CRU’s Tech Team for four years, overseeing sound and video for weekly events of up to 200 people. My senior year, I became Communications Coordinator—leading digital outreach across platforms and launching a YouTube channel for recorded sermons. I also contributed to planning and executing organization-wide events like the Women’s Appreciation event.</p>
